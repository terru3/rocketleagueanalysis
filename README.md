# Rocket League Analysis
This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of professional Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) matches. As of now, there is no "product" or program to be installed, so you are free to view some of the awesome visualizations and see the code in the relevant Jupyter Notebooks. Welcome!

## Background
---

Rocket League, or "soccar", is a vehicular soccar video game developed by Psyonix in 2015. The game features primarily 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 gamemodes in which players control cars on a virtual soccer pitch. The first professional season of RLCS took place in 2016, and since then there have been 12 seasons.

Very generously, Octane.gg has offered a public API storing match data dating back to the very first season, of team and individual player statistics, and this project retrieves, cleans, and gleans insights from said data.
