# Rocket League Analysis
This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of professional Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) matches. As of now, there is no "product" or program to be installed, so you are free to view some of the awesome visualizations and see the code in the relevant Jupyter Notebooks. Welcome!

## Background
---

Rocket League, or "soccar", is a vehicular soccer video game developed by Psyonix in 2015. The game features primarily 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 gamemodes in which players control cars on a virtual soccer pitch. The first professional season of RLCS took place in 2016, and since then there have been 12 seasons.

Very generously, Octane.gg has offered a public API storing match data dating back to the very first season, of team and individual player statistics, and this project retrieves, cleans, and gleans insights from said data. See their website https://octane.gg/ for more cool Rocket League information and https://zsr.octane.gg/ for information on using the API.

As a hobbyist player and fan of the game myself, I was intrigued by what I might be doing differently from the professionals, so I aimed to dive into an advanced analysis of team and individual playstyles, from demo and boost steal frequency to the use of powerslide and time spent in high air, etc. Along the way, I knew I would be bound to uncover exciting new insights about the players that we have come to know and love.
